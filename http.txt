ans :=>
    HTTP is a application layer communiction protocol which standardize how 
    the client and server communicte with each other.It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.
    HTTP is a stateless protocol , that means ,the server doen't keep any data between two requests.

    HTTP/1.1 := 
    It has some limitation that contrained the web performance.
    In this protocol all the resources are requested one at time.If any one of the resources is getting delayed to load 
    ,it affected the entire website to load and took more time.   
    Every HTTP/1.1 request establishes a new connection to the server, incurring the overhead of multiple round-trips.
    HTTP/1.1 supports data compression with GZIP, it can't compress multiple files in parallel. This inefficiency results in longer load times.


    HTTP/2 :=
    It gives a significant performance boost.
    It introduces multiplexing , that means allowing multiple request and response to be processed
     in parallel over a single connection.
    It reduces page load time and increase performance.

     HTTP/2 uses HPACK, a header compression algorithm, to reduce the overhead of sending headers with each request.
      This feature saves bandwidth and speeds up the communication between the client and server.

     HTTP/2 encourages the reuse of connections, 
     further reducing latency and improving efficiency.

    HTTP/2 allows clients to specify the importance of different resources, enabling the server
    to serve the most critical assets first. This results in faster rendering of the web page.
