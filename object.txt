Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs.
These key-value pairs to store and manipulate data.
Obects can contain different data types as its values ,including other objects

 eg:
       const person = {
                      Name: "Robin George",
                        age: 27,

                       address : {

                                 Place: "Kerala",
                                 district:"Idukki:,
                                 pin:787878,
                          }
          };


internal representation:=>

Properties and Values: Objects are collections of key-value pairs. Properties are the keys, and values are the associated data.

Memory Allocation: When an object is created in JavaScript, memory is allocated for it. This memory contains not only the values of the object's properties
 but also some additional information required to manage the object.

Reference to Memory Location: Instead of storing the actual values within the object,
 JavaScript stores references to memory locations where these values are kept. 
 This means that objects are references to data rather than the data themselves
